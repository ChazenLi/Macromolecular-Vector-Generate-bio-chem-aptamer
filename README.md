the prepare for data collect and data-vec                    
step 1: basing on the word embedding or word2vec to trans the location info into vector for next prepare(working)                
ps: the first try was failed cause out of gpu memory ...            
step 2: build GAT training  model to get the space and sequence infor and connection between atoms, residues, chains(preparing)                   
step 3:
ps:  a simple trial that using the embedding and word2vec to trans the char in the 3Dstructure into vectors for training by using the models      
all the data were processed and converted into .pt file for training       
however my computer is out of memory the 4060 can not hold this program which means I have to push this program off
