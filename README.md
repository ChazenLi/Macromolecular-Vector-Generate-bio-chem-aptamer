the prepare for data collect and data-vec                    
step 1: basing on the word embedding or word2vec to trans the location info into vector for next prepare(working)                
ps: the first try was failed cause out of gpu memory ...            
step 2: build GAT training  model to get the space and sequence infor and connection between atoms, residues, chains(preparing)                   
step 3:
